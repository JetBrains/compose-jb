So you want to be a part of "The Compose Revolution" and that's great. Here are some contribution opportunities, in order of difficulty.

## Documentation & Tutorials üìñ

**Difficulty** : Beginner

Go through the docs and tutorials, following the steps in each one. Identify mistakes where things are out of date or don't align with the code or are confusing and submit fixes.


## Community Contributions üëè

**Difficulty** : Beginner

Building cool stuff and posting it on twitter and reddit can help inspire other people to join the community and build cool stuff. You use this as an opportunity to learn Compose, find bugs, and occasionally fix bugs too, all at the same time.  And if you build cool things and share them in open source such that people can share/reuse your code, that can help them get started. Getting people excited and building a great community is important for the success of Compose for Desktop.

## Samples üíª 

**Difficulty** : Intermediate

 Often the samples will be slightly out of date (using an older release of Compose for Desktop) or will have subtle bugs. Cleaning up such bugs helps make the samples look good.


## Widgets üîå

**Difficulty** : Expert

Widgets are usually relatively well-scoped and require less domain knowledge than core contributions.  For example, [CEF](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb/tree/master/cef) doesn't currently work on mac osx.  If you have a mac and are willing to dive into the technicals, that would be very helpful thing to solve.

## Bugs üêõ

**Difficulty** : Depends on the bug

You'll need to use your judgement to find ones that look interesting and are also small enough to tackle.  This requires a bit more knowledge of Compose and would be especially hard for someone who doesn't have lots of experience contributing to open source, so I'd work your way up to this point, aiming for some of the earlier bullet points first.
