Are you looking for ways to contribute to Compose? Here are some opportunities you can explore, in order of difficulty.

## Documentation & Tutorials

**Difficulty** : Beginner

Go through the docs and tutorials, and follow the steps. Identify mistakes and parts that are confusing, and submit fixes.


## Community Contributions

**Difficulty** : Beginner

Inspire other people to try Compose by building cool stuff and posting it on Twitter and Reddit. Sharing your code as open source can also help people get started. Getting people excited and building a great community is important for the success of Compose for Desktop.

## Samples

**Difficulty** : Intermediate

The samples themselves may be slightly out of date (using an older release of Compose for Desktop) or could have subtle bugs. Cleaning up these bugs helps keep the samples looking good.


## Widgets

**Difficulty** : Expert

Widgets are relatively well-scoped and require less domain knowledge than core contributions. Helping to fix issues in these widgets would be incredibly helpful.

## Bugs

**Difficulty** : Varies by bug

You'll need to use your judgment to find bugs that are within your capabilities to tackle. This requires a bit more knowledge of Compose and would be especially hard for someone who doesn't have lots of experience contributing to open source. You should work your way up to this by contributing in other ways.
